Your team has been assigned to make a social network. This social network has a class named Person. However the code was written by the janitor last minute. Use your javascript skills to debug this lovely piece of work.

javascript

function person(nameArg = "unknown", ageArg = 0) {
    var nameFirst = "error";
    try {
        var array = nameArg.split("");
        this.nameFirst = array[0];
        this.nameLast = arrays[1];
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }

    this.age = ageArg;
    this.returnNameFirst = function () {
        return this.nameFirst;
    };
    this.returnNameLast = function () {
        return this.nameLast;
    };
    this.returnAge = function () {
        return this.age;
    };
}
var person3 = new person();
var person = new person("isaac smith", 90);
var person2 = new person("newton granny", 9);
console.log(person3.returnNameFirst() + " " + person3.returnAge());
console.log(person1.returnNameFirst() + " " + person2.returnNameFirst());
console.log(person2.returnNameLast() + " " + person1.returnNameLast());
